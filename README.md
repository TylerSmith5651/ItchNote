# ItchNote
A style driven note-taking app, made to itch my need for a pleasant looking note taker.

A note taking app that looks pleasant while you are typing and allows you to customize the style of each project. 

Essentially I want to make a MarkDown Editor, with a few features that can smartly organize your notes.
* Each Project file has an individual MarkDown(.md) file, CSS file, and some sort of Template file.
* Instead  of employing the use of tags to organize notes, users can mark notes and sub-sections of notes with **symbols**
  * **Symbols** act like tags for search purposes, but they can also apply **templates** to quickly organize a section of your notes
  * Users can create custom **symbols** and custom **templates** to tailor the project's organization to their liking
* Projects should also be able to feel different from one another in style. 
  * Some default project **styles** will exist, but this app is built to encourage the creation of custom **styles**.
  * Different projects require different headspaces. Having a custom look to your project helps reinforce a consistent theme
* While typing, the view stays loosely centered on the text being typed.
  * When you are editing in a different size font relative to nearby text, the view scales up or down if your font size changes.
  * Make sure there is plenty of space between the keyboard boundaries and the focus of the text being typed.
